Summary - Lambda expressions are a fairly simple change to Jav, and the first part of the book shows you how to use them properly.
          Later chapters show you how lambda functions help you to improve performance with parallelism, write simpler concurrent code, #           and model your domain more accurately, including building better DSLs.

Brief overview of contents

- Explore streams, advanced collections, and other Java 8 library improvements
- Leverage multicore CPUs and improve performance with data parallelism
- Use techniques to "lambdify" your existing codebase 
- Learn practical solutions for lambda expression unit testing and debugging
- Implement SOLID principles of object-oriented programming with lambdas
- Write concurrent applications that efficiently perform message passing and non-blocking I/O

I found chapter 8 on using lambdas to simplify certain desing patterns helpful.  This chapter also includes a section on refactoring 
code that implements SOLID principles but using lambdas.
